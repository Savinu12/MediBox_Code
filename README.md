# MediBox_Code
In related to Embedded systems and design project I have designed a Smart Medi-Box by applying ESP32 microcontroller and displayed real time outputs received from Medi-box connected Sensors(DHT-22 Temperature Humidity Sensor etc) through Node Red Dashboard via MQTT broker and developed a real time monitoring Embedded System.
